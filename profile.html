      <br>
      Hi, I'm Jennifer and I've recently earned my certification in Full-stack Software Engineering from Springboard, where I've mastered skills in frontend and backend development, databases, as well as data structures and algorithms.
      <br><br>
      Before embarking on my journey in software engineering, I received my BA in Global Studies, being deeply interested in topics including transnational cultural phenomena, equitable sustainable development and the effects of colonialism in past and current international policy. As someone who embraces both the creative and the analytical, I also have a background in digital media/entertainment and enjoy exploring the broad array of tools and technologies for content development, content creation, marketing, design, and project management.
      <br><br>
      While I am deeply passionate about driving global changes in a positive direction for human welfare through research and storytelling, I want to do more than just discuss the problems of our world. I want to actively work towards solutionsâ€”which is why I decided to transition into tech. I've always been drawn to technology and its potential to solve problems that range from niche pain points to the world's most pressing concerns. I hope to leverage my interdisciplinary educational background and extensive skills in human-centered research and design along with my newly acquired skills in full stack development to provide a unique perspective in the software industry and use innovative technology for good.
      <br><br>
      In my freetime I enjoy traveling, engaging in cultural exchange, photography, playing the guitar and scouring for sustainable fashion finds.
